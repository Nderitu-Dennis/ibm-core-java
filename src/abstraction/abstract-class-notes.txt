An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own. It serves as a blueprint
 for other classes. It can have both abstract methods (methods that are declared without implementation)
 and concrete methods (methods with a complete implementation). The main purpose of an abstract class is
 to provide a common base for other classes, which can then extend it and provide specific implementations
  for the abstract methods.

  an abstract class cannot be instantiated
  abstract methods are declared but not defined-they dont have a body

  Concrete Methods: An abstract class can also have methods with full implementation,
   just like a regular class. Subclasses can either use these methods or override them.

   A subclass that extends an abstract class must implement all of its abstract methods unless the subclass is also abstract
