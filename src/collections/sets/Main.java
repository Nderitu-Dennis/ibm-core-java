package collections.sets;

/*
* Set is an interface within the Java Collections Framework (part of the java.util package)
 that represents an unordered collection of unique elements. This means a Set cannot contain duplicate values.
* If an attempt is made to add a duplicate element, the Set will ignore it, and its content will remain
 unchanged.

* Key characteristics of Java Sets:**

1. Uniqueness: They store only unique elements.
2. Unordered (generally): Set implementations typically do not guarantee any specific order of elements,
  though some implementations like LinkedHashSet preserve insertion order and TreeSet orders elements
 based on their natural ordering or a custom Comparator.
3. No Index-based Access: Elements cannot be accessed by an index, unlike List implementations.
4. Mathematical Set Abstraction: They model the mathematical concept of a set, allowing for operations
like union, intersection, and difference.

**Common Implementations of the Set Interface:**
- HashSet: The most common and generally best-performing implementation. It stores elements in a
 hash table and offers fast operations, but it does not guarantee any order of elements.
- LinkedHashSet: This implementation maintains the insertion order of elements. It uses a hash table
*  for storage and a linked list to maintain the order.
- TreeSet: This implementation stores elements in a sorted order, either based on their natural ordering
* (if elements implement Comparable) or a custom Comparator. It is based on a red-black tree data structure,
* making it slower than HashSet for basic operations but providing ordered iteration.*/
